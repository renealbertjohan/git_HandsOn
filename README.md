This repository contains a python script "seqClass.py" to detect if your sequence is DNA, RNA or neither, where it could also detect if there is a motif in your DNA/RNA sequence.
Moreover, the script computes, given a DNA or RNA sequence, the percentage of each nucleotide. A Dockerfile could be find in the map docker.
