# **git_HandsOn** 
For the epigenomics course of the Master in Omics Data Analysis from the UVIC, the students had to perform different task to get familiar with using Git and GitHub. In this repository, the results are presented from these [git_HandsOn exercises](https://github.com/dgarrimar/teaching/wiki/Git-hands%E2%80%90on). There are three different branches included in this repository: master (default), fix and percentage.

# **Script**
This repository contains a python script (**seqClass.py**) to detect if your sequence is DNA, RNA or neither, where it could also detect if there is a motif in your DNA/RNA sequence. Moreover, the script computes, given a DNA or RNA sequence, the percentage of each nucleotide. A Dockerfile could be find in the map docker.
